Abstract  <br/>
This report outlines the design and operational concepts for a lunar base focusing on mission architecture, location, environmental adaptations, operational components, personnel, and activities. The lunar base will serve as a sustainable habitat for scientific research, resource utilization, and technological development. The mission will involve multiple phases, including robotic pre-deployment, crew arrival, and gradual expansion. The base will be located near the lunar south pole to leverage permanent sunlight for solar power and access to water ice. Environmental challenges such as radiation, temperature extremes, and lunar dust will be addressed through advanced technologies and infrastructure. The report concludes with implications for future human exploration and the importance of safety in lunar colonization.
