Description

In this capstone module, you represent a research team of your choice. Your team has developed a realistic scientific research proposal that was submitted to Wallops for critical review.  Wallops has communicated with your team that they have accepted your ideas and would like to help you integrate your project onto one of the launch platforms supported by the flight facility.

Now you have to request funding for your project so that your project can continue. This funding request comes in the form of a technical report.

Get creative and brainstorm several ideas for this final report! Select one, and be sure that the proposal you choose to write about is a realistic one and one that can be supported by a NASA Wallops Flight Facility platform.

  

Directions

The technical report proposal you submit to NASA Wallops Flight Facility should outline the components of your research project.  Your proposal should include the following:

Abstract: The abstract should be clear, concise, and engaging. Describes and connects the topic to research and purpose.  Identifies methods used to support the mission. Provides an explanation of what was expected, and discovered. Also, provides an explanation of what could be accomplished, collected, and produced. The length should be  250- 150 words. 

What is an abstract? An abstract is like a summary at the beginning of a research paper. It gives a quick overview of what the paper is about, including its main points and findings. Think of it as a sneak peek that helps readers decide if they want to read the whole paper or not.

Introduction: Your introduction should be engaging and state the main ideas and subtopics clearly
Body Paragraphs
Mission Subject and Science Objectives: Explain your mission. What are your mission and science goals?
Mission Platform:  Describe what platform you are using and why?
Mission Elements:  What data is to be collected? (temperature, pressure, radiation, etc.) What instrumentation would be used to collect this data? (see Module 3/4 for ideas) At what altitude is this data collected? 
Research Team:  In one short paragraph, provide an overview of who the research team presenting this mission proposal to NASA is? (Private industry, government, university, military, etc) 
Mission Duration:  Provide a timeline for your mission. 
Mission Patch: Design a mission patch and add it as a figure in your paper. You will describe your mission patch in one paragraph. Does your patch clearly represent the science, mission type, and name of the mission? Is your patch creative and colorful? Does your patch show you have researched your mission platform? Describe and explain the logic for designing your patch. 
How to design your patch? You have several options:
You can draw a patch by hand and upload it to the site or 
You can use a software program that you are familiar with that will allow you to create a patch (Canva, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc
Refer to module 4, Chapter 3.6 The Mission Patch for more information!

Mission Stakeholders:  Write a brief description of the research that you are conducting and how this research will benefit stakeholders and the public.Mission Constraints: What are the limiting factors of the mission? (time, size, instrumentation availability, etc.)
What is a stakeholder? In the context of NASA mission design, a stakeholder is anyone who has an interest or investment in the success of the mission. This could include NASA scientists and engineers, government agencies, industry partners, international collaborators, and even the general public. Stakeholders play a crucial role by providing input, resources, and support to ensure that the mission meets its goals and objectives.
Conclusion:  Your conclusion should wrap up the main ideas without restating them verbatim.
