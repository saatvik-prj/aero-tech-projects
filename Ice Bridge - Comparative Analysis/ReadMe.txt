Purpose

The purpose of this report is to conduct a comprehensive examination of a NASA mission supported by a specific launch platform, focusing on its objectives, scientific goals, stakeholders, and instrumentation. By analyzing the mission's characteristics and requirements, as well as its potential impact, students will gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between space missions and their launch platforms. Furthermore, this report engages students in critical thinking by challenging them to identify and evaluate an alternative launch platform for the chosen mission, considering both its advantages and limitations. Through this process, students will develop analytical skills and a thorough understanding of the variety of launch platforms supported by NASA Wallops Flight Facility. 

  

Background

NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, stands as a cornerstone of America's space exploration efforts. Established in 1945, Wallops has evolved into a premier launch facility, specializing in a diverse array of missions spanning suborbital research, scientific exploration, and technology development. Operating under the guidance of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Wallops boasts state-of-the-art facilities and a rich history of supporting groundbreaking missions that have contributed to our understanding of Earth, space, and the universe beyond.

At the heart of Wallops' mission is its commitment to advancing scientific discovery and technological innovation through the utilization of various launch platforms. From its expansive launch pads to its cutting-edge research facilities, Wallops offers a versatile and dynamic environment that can support a wide range of Earth and space exploration missions. Among the launch platforms supported by Wallops are sounding rockets, scientific balloons, airborne science platforms, and small satellites (small sats), each tailored to meet the unique requirements of specific missions.

Sounding rockets, a mainstay of Wallops' launch capabilities, provide researchers with access to the upper atmosphere and near-space environment, enabling them to conduct experiments and observations in regions beyond the reach of traditional aircraft. These suborbital missions, often lasting only minutes, yield invaluable data on phenomena ranging from atmospheric dynamics to cosmic radiation, contributing to our understanding of Earth's atmosphere and space beyond.

Scientific balloons represent another pillar of Wallops' launch infrastructure, offering scientists a cost-effective and flexible platform for conducting long-duration experiments at altitudes exceeding 100,000 feet. These balloons, equipped with sophisticated instrumentation, allow researchers to study a wide range of phenomena, including atmospheric composition, cosmic rays, and celestial objects, with unparalleled precision and sensitivity.

In addition to sounding rockets and scientific balloons, Wallops supports airborne science platforms, such as research aircraft, which enable scientists to conduct observations and experiments within Earth's atmosphere. These platforms, equipped with advanced sensors and instrumentation, provide researchers with a unique vantage point from which to study atmospheric dynamics, climate change, and natural phenomena with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Furthermore, Wallops serves as a hub for the field of small satellite (small sat) technology, facilitating the rapid development and deployment of miniature spacecraft for a variety of scientific, commercial, and educational missions. Leveraging its expertise in launch operations and mission management, Wallops enables researchers to harness the capabilities of small sats to address pressing scientific questions and technological challenges in space exploration.

This technical report seeks to analyze NASA missions supported by Wallops' launch platforms and evaluate their potential for scientific and technological advancement.
