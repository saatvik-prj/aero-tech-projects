Abstract <br />
NASA’s IceBridge mission is an important scientific endeavor within the realm of Earth’s polar extremes. The mission was to understand the connections between polar ice regions and the global climate system (MacGregor, 2024). IceBridge was a vital link between the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) missions, providing more observations on the polar landscape. This report will dive deeper into the mission’s main goals, examine stakeholder involvement, explain the instrumentation used, and analyze another possible platform that could have been implemented.
