NASA Case Study:  All Shook Up - The LADEE Spacecraft Vibration Mishap

 


May 3, 2012, Bay Area, California: Vibration testing was commencing for the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft Engineering Test Unit (ETU). LADEE’s purpose was to orbit the Moon’s equatorial region for approximately 1 month to collect data on the lunar dust conditions to help guide the possible design for lunar outposts and future robotic missions. The LADEE mission also studied the fragile lunar atmosphere before further human activity contamination occurred. However, during vibration testing, an anomalous sine burst test at a contractor test facility damaged the spacecraft.
