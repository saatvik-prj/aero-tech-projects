Case Study LADEE Mission Mishap
The revolutionizing LADEE mission was designed to study and collect data on dust
conditions on the lunar surface and atmosphere. As a part of this mission, LADEE would help
develop future designs for lunar outposts and robotic missions, however, it suffered a major
setback during vibration testing. Several changes were made in risk management, team
responsibilities, and preparedness as a result of this mishap.
