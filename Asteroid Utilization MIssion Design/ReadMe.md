Abstract
The Asteroid Utilization Mission (AUM) is designed to investigate and access a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) for potential resource extraction. The mission will employ an autonomous spacecraft equipped with advanced drilling tools and spectrometers to detect and evaluate valuable materials such as water, metals, and rare Earth minerals (REMs). The AUM’s overarching objective is to develop technologies essential for asteroid mining and to gather important data for future space resource extraction. The mission will operate within a 24-month timeframe and aims to be the foundation for sustainable extraterrestrial mining operations. Additionally, the AUM expects to address the growing demand for resources in a sustainable way, mitigating reliance on Earth’s finite resources.
