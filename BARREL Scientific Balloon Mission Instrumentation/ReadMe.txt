Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is for scholars to explore and analyze a mission supported by one of NASA Wallops Flight Facilities (WFF) platforms. Scholars will write an APA style technical report that focuses on the instrument package utilized during the chosen mission. Through this assignment, scholars will develop their research and analytical skills by thoroughly examining the mission instrument package, contributing to a deeper understanding of the scientific endeavors facilitated by NASA Wallops Flight Facility.

  

Background 

NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility provides agile, low-cost flight and launch range services to meet government and commercial sector needs for accessing flight regimes worldwide from the Earth’s surface to the moon and beyond.

Wallops’ flight assets ranging from research aircraft, unmanned aerial systems and high-altitude balloons to suborbital and orbital rockets provide a full-range of capability while operational launch range and airfield capabilities meet ongoing and emerging needs in the science, aerospace, defense, and commercial industries. In addition, Wallops is a multi-user/multi-tenant facility in a geographic location ideal for supporting satellite tracking and commanding, military operations and training, scientific investigations, technology development and testing, as well as commercial aerospace. The facility’s diverse mission sets and on-site partners, including the U.S. Navy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, Virginia Space and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, is a model for leveraging and optimizing multi-organizational capabilities and support services.

Wallops provides many different platforms for science and technology research, including Sounding Rockets, Scientific Balloons, Airborne Science and SmallSat Support. NASA launches suborbital and orbital missions from sites established in the U.S. and around the world to meet investigators’ needs.

For this assignment, your technical report will explore and analyze one of 10 missions supported by NASA Wallops Flight Facility. The focus will be on examining the chosen mission and analyzing the instrumentation utilized.
