MISSION: Lunar Gateway Innovation Design Technical Report

Building the Lunar Gateway will require more space-walking hours than have ever been attempted in space before. The mission of this Technical Report is to design and describe a completely new innovation or modification of an already-existing space-based tool of your choosing that would be able to assist astronauts in construction or in running of the day-to-day operations of the Lunar Gateway.

To help you get started, look at the challenges involved in Working Aloft (link directs to you readings in this module) -- what tools work easily on Earth but are more challenging to deal with in space? Could a small (or very large) robotic innovation help astronauts significantly?

Here are some potential topics to consider as technology areas that NASA needs to develop in order to have a functioning Lunar Gateway:

Temperature Regulation
Sustainable Power Sources
Radiation Protection
Communication Systems
Human Comfort Systems
You could come up with a design / innovation that affects just one of the above topics, more than one of the above topics, or other areas of challenge for an orbiting space station.

 

Keep in mind:

The laws of physics still apply - what does being in lunar orbit affect for this creation?
The vacuum of space affects technologies as well as living things.
The needs of the crew members
The limitations of the current space suits if astronauts are working outside of the
The design of the Gateway that differs from the ISS
This innovation can be used by the crew on a spacewalk (Extra Vehicular Activity) or inside the Lunar Gateway. It can be a remotely operated or manually controlled piece of equipment, a tool, a process or even software. It can address any type of construction action on the Lunar Gateway, to include additions of new modules, repairs / maintenance of existing modules, or re-arrangements / modifications of existing modules with new features in the future.

 The following aspects of the Lunar Gateway Innovation Design must be discussed in depth:

Function: The innovation's overall purpose (what it does) and how it will help in the construction or maintenance process.
Control: Whether the system is remotely controlled or manually controlled.
Description: An explanation of how each component of the innovation works.
Training: An explanation of how the astronauts would be trained to work with this innovation (e.g., hands-on, mock-up, computer simulations, etc.)
You will have to research the current state of similar technologies in use on the ISS or other space habitats and then note how your concept goes beyond what we have used before.
