Adaptive Radiation Shielding for the Lunar Gateway
Radiation exposure poses a significant challenge for astronauts operating in the Lunar Gateway. Unlike Earth, the Moonâ€™s orbit lacks atmospheric or magnetic shielding, exposing the crew members to harmful cosmic rays and solar particle events. Effective radiation protection is essential for the health and safety of the astronauts, especially during long-term missions. The Adaptive Radiation Shielding (ARS) system helps solve this problem with advanced materials, deployment mechanisms, and real-time monitoring. This system keeps astronauts safe during the construction and operation of the Gateway, while meeting the weight and efficiency requirements of space travel.
