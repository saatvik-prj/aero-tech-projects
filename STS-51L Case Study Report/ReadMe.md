Case Study:
The STS-51L Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986, was a significant failure in
engineering and decision-making. Known technical issues with the O-rings were overlooked due
to organizational pressure, leading to the launch despite unsafe conditions. This report examines
the ethical violations, technical problems, and organizational pressures that caused the tragedy,
highlighting key lessons for future space missions.
