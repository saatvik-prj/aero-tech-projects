Abstract <br />
This report proposes a long-duration experiment to investigate the viability of plant growth in Martian regolith, utilizing resources available on Mars and during transit. The experiment aligns with the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) Goal 2: "Determine if life ever arose on Mars" and Goal 4: "Prepare for human exploration." (Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group et al., 2018). The study will examine the physical responses of plants grown in Martian regolith simulant under controlled conditions, with data collected over three months, six months, and one year. The experiment will require specialized equipment, including growth chambers, nutrient solutions, and power systems. Results will provide critical insights into the potential for sustainable agriculture on Mars, which is essential for long-term human habitation. The findings will also contribute to our understanding of plant biology in extreme environments, with potential applications for improving agricultural practices on Earth.
