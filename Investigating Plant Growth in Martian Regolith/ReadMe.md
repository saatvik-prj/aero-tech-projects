Long Duration Experiment Report

In this Technical Report, you are to design an experiment to be performed on the surface of Mars by astronauts 
who have reached the planet. You can assume that the astronauts have a pre-planned Concept of Operations to reach the planet, 
so this report should not be focused on how to get to Mars itself. Your experiment should note the MEPAG goal(s) to which it is aligned.
