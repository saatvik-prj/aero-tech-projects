As we head back to the moon with the Artemis Mission, the more we can learn of its surface and cratering, the better our ability to determine a safe landing zone.  We do this by spatial resolution and remote sensing.   

A basic feature of any optical system is how well it can discern small features in the scene being photographed.   Spatial resolution allows a remote sensing system to take images of an object at a resolution high enough for scientists to conduct an investigation of contents, scale, and surface details in the target. The target can be the surface of Earth, the sun, a planet, or features within a distant nebula, star cluster or galaxy. Usually, the desired spatial resolution is known in advance, and the optical system is designed to meet this resolution. Sometimes, major discoveries in science can be made just by having an image clear enough to reveal previously hidden details.  

Astronomers and mission specialists need to determine actual distances and geographical feature sizes and can only rely on photographs and images.  How do they do that? They use remote sensing and spatial resolution; the objective of this assignment. 

You will determine the number of craters of different sizes and then determine the distance between craters to determine if this area might be a feasible Artemis landing site.  Using this actual lunar image, you will calculate average distances between craters of varying sizes and provide some analyses of your information. 

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) satellite recently imaged the surface of the moon at a resolution of 1.4 meters/pixel. The above image shows a region near the Apollo-11 landing site. The Lunar Module (LM) can be seen from its very long shadow near the large crater in the upper left corner of the image (inside the orange circle; how cool is that?).   

 

 

 

SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS ON A SEPARATE SHEET (40 POINTS TOTAL) 

Materials needed to complete this assignment: 

Ruler with mm  

Calculator 

   

Problem 1A - With a millimeter ruler, determine the scale of this image in meters/mm (round to the nearest hundredth). How many meters does 1 mm represent (round to nearest hundredth)? Show your work and circle the final answer. (3 points)

**NOTE: The white bar representing 500. meters should be between 10.5 cm and 16 cm long.  If it is not, resize the image until it fits within that range.**

  

Problem 1B --What is the total area of this image in square-kilometers?  Be aware of the units shown and the final units required.  Be sure to show all your work and include units in all calculations, your final answer should contain 3 sig figs.  Circle your final answer.  (3 points)

 

COPY THE TABLE BELOW INTO EXCEL OR GOOGLE SHEETS. 

    

Problem 2A. – If a crater measured from the image is 2 mm across, how many meters across is the actual crater? Show your work, circle your answer and round to the nearest tenth. Put your answer in column 2 and then complete the rest of the column 2.  (3 points)

  

Problem 2B. – On the image, measure and count all the 2 mm craters, then all the 4 mm craters, etc. to complete column 3.  (3 points)

   

Problem 2C. – Do you think all the students will have the same numbers in column 3?  Explain why or why not. (2 points)

 



  

Problem 2D. -- Divide the number of craters by the total area of the field (solved in problem 1), to get the Areal Cratee Density (Ac) craters/km2.  Show all work, circle answers and round to the nearest tenth. Fill in the 4th column with answers. (3 points)

  

Problem 2E. -- Using Excel or Google sheets, create a bar graph of the numbers of craters at each diameter (use columns 2 and 3). Be sure to include axis labels and title. (5 points)

  

Problem 3A. -- The average distance between craters of a given size is found by taking the square-root of the reciprocal of Ac:  Avg Dis = √(1/Ac). Show all work, circle answers and Round to the nearest hundredth.  Fill in column 5 with answers. (3 points)

  

Problem 3B.  -- Make a scatterplot (use columns 2 and 5) and show a trend line for the data. Be sure to include title and axis labels.  (5 points)

  

Problem 3C. -- Interpolating, determine the approximate distance between craters with a diameter close to 25 meters.  What is this approximate average distance? Answer should be rounded to the nearest hundredth and circled.   (2 points)

   

Problem 4.  -- Approximately how large in diameter, in meters, is the largest crater on the image? Show your work and the answer should be to the nearest tenth. Circle Answer.  (2 points)

  

Problem 5.  -- Name one other characteristic about a crater that might be important.  Can this information be determined from the image?  Explain your answer. If you use any sources for information, be sure to provide the title and weblink (does not have to be in APA). (2 points)

  

Problem 6.  -- Using your data and your knowledge of the Artemis mission, explain whether you think this would be a good or poor place to locate the Artemis lander.  Be sure to provide at least two points; either positive or negative or both. If you use any sources for information, be sure to provide the title and weblink (does not have to be in APA).  (4 points)
