Mars Surface Base - Concept of Operations Proposal


Concept Requirements:

Final Project: A Con-Ops
Identify the mission goals
Correlate goals to the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group goals discussed in Module 7
Identification and drafting of S.M.A.R.T. mission and system requirements (review the definition of S.M.A.R.T. requirements before you start writing!)
Generate a Concept of Operations (Con-ops) for your surface base (from launch from Earth to returning crew safely to Earth)
Description of major phases (from launch, to surface landing, to base establishment, to ascent, to safe return of crew to Earth)
Identification and integration of mission elements (includes hardware and systems to keep crew healthy and alive)
Identification, allocation, and justification of crew functions and tasks in support of the mission goals and objectives (Begin by brainstorming what types of people and skills you will need to have present in your surface base to make it successful. Who are the inhabitants? Is it a U.S. or international mission?)
Number of women and men, age distribution of inhabitants.
What is their job specialization? What is the justification for work assignment? Who does what and why?
Generate a Scope Summary page (see Module 5 technical report and Mission Scope Presentation for review and assistance)
