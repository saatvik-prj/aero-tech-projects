Mission Design Technical Report


Note: Resubmission of a report created for a different program will result in immediate detection by the TurnItIn plagiarism software and your report will be treated as a plagiarized document. Do Not Submit A Report From Virginia Space Coast Scholars Module 4. You must write a new report for this assignment that meets the specific requirements given below:

The goal of this report is to understand that science and scientific investigation drives the engineering and mission design process.  The final project for the course will be to design a mission concept when given a problem to solve under a set of parameters and constraints.  Progressing through each module will help to develop and hone the necessary skills to be successful in the mission design project.  In addition, technical writing skills will be emphasized throughout this course, starting with this Technical Report assignment.

With this activity, the goal is to use the first step or phase of the space systems engineering design process to begin to put together a mission. The reading in the Designing for Space book indicates that a mission has defined requirements and constraints. To communicate the requirements and constraints, a thorough mission statement must be developed and defined.

 

Goal: Design a space mission and write a mission statement. It is up to the student to determine what this mission entails as well as what major constraints are placed upon the mission. Ultimately this assignment will test both the creativity of the mission and will require an attention to detail regarding constraints and mutually exclusive possibilities in small spacecraft or rockets. All of the answers to the trade-offs at play in these scenarios may not be available, but there should most definitely have reasons for all of listed choices regarding this mission.


State the mission objective - why is this mission being done?
Identify the mission users - who will benefit from or use the information produced by the mission?
Create an operations concept - how will the identified mission elements fit together?
Identify mission constraints - what are some limiting factors for this mission?
 

 

Specific Objective:

Write a Mission Statement that is at least 750 words / 1.5 pages in length describing an original space mission design. This is effectively describing the operational concept of the entire mission by assembling an arrangement of:

Mission subject
Mission type
Mission users
Mission duration
Mission elements (spacecraft and scientific hardware)
Decisions must be made to focus this mission in the five areas listed in the table below. Possible choices are listed below each topic. As any combination of these choices can work together, it is up to the student to determine the best concept for each individual mission.

Simply choosing from each column is not enough -- each choice must be justified! This space mission is unique, so the Mission Statement must include rationale for every choice, especially when a choice might introduce trade-offs or constraints that are initially not realized.

For example, if the mission plans include scientific instrumentation on-board an earth-orbiting satellite, what other equipment might be impossible to fit on the same spacecraft? Or perhaps a ultra-long duration space probe requires excessively powerful antennas to communicate with Ground Control at huge distances, so it might not have power for many other spacecraft features.
